The testbench comprises three tests covering single-controller-single-periphey system and single-master-multiple-peripheral unit scenarios.
The SPI communication protocol sub-modules are teste for a single-master and four peripheral units. This is illustrated in the following figure taken from the RTL-viewer in Quartus environment:
